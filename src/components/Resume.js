This research allowed me to utilize my interest and knowledge of the blockchain technology while also allowing me to get familiar with some business aspects. \n I mapped out the Voluntary Carbon Market, pointed out sustainable blockchains protocols, investigated NFT technology, considered NWG's role in the space and more. My thoroughness and understanding granted me a grade of 12 on this research, which is the highest obtainable mark in the Danish grading system. ",
